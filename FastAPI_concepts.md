## What is FastAPI?
Modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. 
It's primarily built on top of 2 Python libraries:
1. **Starlette:** Manages how the API receives requests and sends back responses
2. **Pydantic:** Used to check the data coming into the API and in the right format


## USP of FastAPI:
1. Fast to Run
