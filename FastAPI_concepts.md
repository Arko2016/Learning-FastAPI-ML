## What is FastAPI?
Modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. 
It's primarily built on top of 2 Python libraries:
1. **Starlette:** Manages how the API receives requests and sends back responses
2. **Pydantic:** Used to check the data coming into the API and in the right format


## USP of FastAPI:
1. Fast to Run

2. Fast to Code
    - Automatic Input validation -> through Pydantic
    - Auto-generated interactive documentation
    - Seamless integration with modern MLOps/DevOps ecosystem (Docker, Kubernetes, ML libraries)
